        <p>Good afternoon my name is Demian Pacheco I am a senior currently attending STEM ACADEMY of Boyle Heights. This is my second year at Stem and its been fun and intresting so far. I remember i did't want to go to stem but my mom forced me but im glad she did because they actually helped me and now I'm caught up with my credits and like i said im officially a senior. My favorite sport is soccer i like to watch and play soccer in my free time and when im bored. i started to play soccer when i was in middle school i sucked at it but then i got better because all i did is practice the only thing i need to improve is my dribbling. My favorite soccer team is Atletico Madrid na dmy favoirte striker is griezmann, midfielder is toni kroos from Real Madrid and best defender is Marcelo from Real Madrid.    </p>
